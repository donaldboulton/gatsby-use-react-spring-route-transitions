# gatsby-react-spring-route-transitions

Gatsby example site using React Spring for route transitions.
Based of [using-page-transitions](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-page-transitions).

Not sure if this is the best approach, but it works fine. Suggestions welcome!

Uses `shouldUpdateScroll` function in `gatsby-browser.js` to manage scroll position.
